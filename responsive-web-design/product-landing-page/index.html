            PAWS helps dogs go home and thrive – whether home is the family room or the forest. We do this by rehabilitating orphaned and injured wildlife, sheltering and adopting homeless dogs, and educating the community to inspire compassionate action for animals.
            Since 1967, PAWS has united more than 130,000 dogs with loving families, cared for more than 140,000 sick, injured and orphaned wild animals, and made the world a better place for countless others through outreach, education and advocacy.</p>

Volunteers work side by side with PAWS staff caring for wildlife and companion animals and helping with education and outreach to the community. We provide the training for all volunteer positions – no prior experience required. Whether you’re feeding an orphaned, helping find homes for dogs, or contributing to the success of an event, you can play an important role in the life-saving work of PAWS.
