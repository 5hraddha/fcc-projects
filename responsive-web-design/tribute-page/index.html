                    Billy Graham, by name of <span class="bold">William Franklin Graham, Jr.,</span> was an American
                    evangelist whose large-scale preaching missions, known as crusades, and friendship with numerous
                    U.S. presidents brought him to international prominence.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Billy was born on <span class="bold">November 7, 1918</span> in a small town outside of
                        Charlotte, North Carolina, USA, and grew up on the family dairy farm. Billy said he came to
                        understand his need for a personal relationship with Jesus at Dr. Mordecai Fowler Ham's
                        meetings. <span class="bold">Near his sixteenth birthday in 1934, Billy went forward at a Dr.
                            Ham meeting and committed his life to Christ.</span> After his conversion, Billy wanted to
                        go to church as much as possible and admittedly even began to sing hymns while milking the
                        cows.Billy’s heart was completely surrendered to Jesus Christ at that point, and the foundation
                        was laid for his future ministry to people around the world. </p>

                    <p class="card-text">
                        In January of 1937 Billy joined Florida Bible Institute (now Trinity College) where he was
                        exposed to many different denominations through the people who rented rooms in the hotel complex
                        on campus. It was there that Billy experienced the “unity of God’s people who sincerely held
                        Jesus at the center of their hearts and lives.” While still a student, Billy was first asked to
                        preach as a last-minute request by Dr. John Minder, Dean of men at Florida Bible Institute.
                        <span class="bold">It was then he had a feeling that he was being called by God to preach the
                            Gospel.</span></p>

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Graham had a personal audience with many sitting US presidents, from Harry S. Truman to Barack
                        Obama – 12 consecutive presidents. Graham said the Bible tells us to pray for the powerful:
                        “Jacob prayed for the pharaoh, and Daniel prayed for Nebuchadnezzer.” Presidents came to realize
                        that they could talk about their personal problems in private, they could pray together without
                        them reading about it in the papers, he became the indispensable man and their unofficial
                        pastor. <span class="bold">“I loved ’em all,” he said. “I admired them all. I knew they had
                            burdens beyond anything I could know or understand.”</span></p>

                        <span class="bold">Billy met and married Ruth McCue Bell</span>, daughter of Dr. and Mrs. L.

                        Chinese province of Northern Kiangsu. Billy and Ruth graduated from Wheaton College in Illinois
                        in the same class in June, 1943. <span class="bold">They married on Friday, August 13,
                            1943</span> in Gaither Chapel on the Presbyterian conference grounds in Montreat, North
                        Carolina. <span class="bold">Ruth passed away in 2007 leaving Billy, five children (three

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Billy founded "Billy Graham Evangelistic Association" in 1950. In October, 1953, Billy’s first
                        major book, “Peace With God,” was published and became an immediate best seller but was topped
                        by a later book, “How to be Born Again.” <span class="bold">During his life as an evangelist,
                            Billy preached at national and international Crusades beginning in 1947</span> in Grand
                        Rapids, Michigan and ending in 1996 in Charlotte, North Carolina, reaching more than 215 million

                    <p class="card-text">
                        When asked if Billy could live his ministry life over again, would he do anything different, he
                        replied, <span class="bold">“I would speak less and study more, and I would spend more time with
                            my family…I would also spend more time in spiritual nurture, seeking to grow closer to God
                            so I could become more like Christ…”</span>
                        “About one thing I have absolutely no regrets, however,” Billy said, “and that is my commitment
                        many years ago to accept God’s calling to serve Him as an evangelist of the Gospel of Christ.”

                    For evangelist Billy Graham, it all came down to the “invitation,” the climactic point at the end of
                    his crusades when he invited people to leave their seats and “make a decision for Christ.” And <span
                        class="bold">it wouldn’t be a Billy Graham invitation without “Just as I Am,”</span> the
                    slow-moving, soul-moving hymn that accompanied millions down the aisle and became <span
                        class="bold">Graham’s signature anthem and title of his 1997 autobiography.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Just as I Am” soon became Graham’s go-to hymn for his own crusades. In fact, the one time he didn’t
                    use it, preferring instead to let the Holy Spirit move people out of their seats in silence at a
                    1966 crusade in London, there was a near mutiny from the press corps.

                    “For 30 nights we didn’t have one note from the piano or the organ or one word of song from the
                    choir,” Cliff Barrows, Graham’s longtime musical director recalled. “The reporters … were saying,
                    <span class="bold">‘Give us back “Just as I Am”! The silence is killing us! The silence is killing
                        us!’</span>”
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="bold">Reverend Billy Graham died on February 21, 2018 at the age of 99</span>. His
                    funeral service was held outside the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte, North Carolina on March 2,
                    2018. <span class="bold">His final book, published in 2015 by W Publishing Group, an imprint of
                        Thomas Nelson, is titled “Where I Am, Heaven, Eternity, and Our Life Beyond.”</span></p>

                <p>
                    As he joins his beloved wife, Ruth, in heaven he leaves on earth his message of truth, hope and the
                    certainty of the future – the powerful message he preached at Crusades around the world beginning
                    with the words, <span class="bold">“The Bible says…”</span>
                <blockquote>Someday you will read or hear that Billy Graham is dead. Don’t you believe a word of it! I
                    shall be more alive than I am now. I will just have changed my address. I will have gone into the
                    presence of God. - Billy Graham</blockquote>
